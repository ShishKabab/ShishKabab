# Hi, I'm Vincent!

**IÂ help people** rethink how they collaborate building digital products and deconstruct complex problems. I write about this [here](https://www.vdenboer.com/).

Currently, I'm researching and helping to implement ways of speeding up developement workflows and connect them with other teams throughout organizations. For example, I've developed a system using scenario replays that:

*  generates design documentation that never can go out of sync with the actual product.
*  allows developers to cut manual actions out of the edit-compile-test cycle to jump straight to what they want to work on.
*  allows testers to record bugs reproductions and send them to developers who can dive straight into the code.

Also, while building [Memex](https://memex.garden/) I designed and built [Storex](https://github.com/WorldBrain/storex), the storage layer that allowed us to evolve from a single-device product to multi-device peer-to-peer encrypted sync to cloud based with just a 2 developer team. It currently works with IndexedDB, SQLite and Firestore, allowing to share code across the web extension, the React Native app and our Node.js backend. You can read about the original thoughts behind the design [here](https://www.vdenboer.com/blog/storex-modular-storage) and soon I'll write an article about the lessons learned using it in production for more than 3 years.
